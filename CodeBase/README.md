# Code Base

This Code is a code base for trajectory prediction task.

## dataset

dataset contains:
- SDD(with image)
- inD(with image)
- ETH/UCY(without image)
we will try to add ETH/UCY(with image) after reproducing Y-net results in ETH/UCY

## Train

Use the train.sh to train model
```shell
sh train.sh config/<config_file>
```

## TEST

Use the eval.sh to test model
```shell
sh eval.sh config/<config_file>
```

## NOTATION
